#Smoothie Project (API)


I made this project in order to save and find easily a smoothie, I use to drink
a lot of them so I think it can help me (and maybe you too) to find out smoothies.

##Add your favorites smoothies
So the goal of this project is to able people to add their favorites smoothies
and comment out other smoothies.

##Search engine
Another goal is to help you choose a smoothie. To do so I build a "search engine"
based on a list of fruits, example: you type "orange apple strawberry" and
the app returns a list of smoothies that meet your requirements, for example
apple + strawberry. I thought of this feature because when you search for
a smoothie you too often end up with a recipe that contains all sort of things
that you don't have...so you are not able do the smoothie (except if you go shopping).
With this "search engine" it should not be possible, all the recipes have to fit at
most with all the fruits you look for but not more.

##Stack
I build this API using Express (NodeJS) and MongoDB for storing data. I'm currently
working on the website (I use Angular + Bootstrap to achieve that). If you want
to improve the API (by rewriting some code, or add functionalities) send me a request
and I'll give you access to do so.
If you are a front-end and want to get involved in the website part, ask me I'll be
happy to get some help on it.

##Suggestions
If you are not a NodeJS fan or just don't have time to participate but you have a
good idea (at least you think it is), send me your idea and I'll do my best
(if it worth it) to implement this idea.


##English
If my English sucks...I'm French, sorry for that ;-)
